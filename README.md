# Maze Generator
Creates and displays a maze.

The maze algorithm works by:
1. Randomly picking a valid direction.
2. Adding it the maze and repeating.
3. Continuing until a dead-end is reached.
4. Randomly picking a part of the maze to repeat.

Shows a line between two points on the maze.

Left and right click changes the two points.
